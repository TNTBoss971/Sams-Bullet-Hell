    BOSS IDEAS
    -Computer parts

    Final boss: the motherboard

    Fans: Melee Focused
        like sawblades
    
    CPU: Summons based
        tatiction in first phase, shoots sniper shots until minions are killed
        then overclocks and becomes more aggrasive.
    
    
    GPU: Stealth Bomber
        Static discharge (uses a lot of power)
        sets bomb traps
        fire attack, i guess
        

    RAM and SSD: double trouble!
        RAM has faster, lighter attacks

        SSD fires harder hitting attacks, but less often
    
    Power Supply: lighting and paralaze
        lightning attack
